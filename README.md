#### Design Summary
* Strategy
    * User needs:
        * had changing event(s) that was pivotal in their lives and want to start sharing through an anonymous, but community platform
        * engage with other people who have secrets they want to disclose (could relate to them, or even offer advice of how they got through that **similar** event)
        * Share troubles and ache life events, can help alleviate the burden of holding it in - be completely open, raw, and unguarded with their heart, mind, and soul.
            * *"Vulnerabilty is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change."* - Dr. Brené Brown
    * Designer needs:
        * no text is involved, so want users to share and convey information via image
        * encourage users to share their secrets that have influenced their lives, and hopefully that will allow them to be vulnerable and begin the process of healing
    * Audience:
        * Anyone and everyone who is ready to be vulnerable, and want to visually express their secrets that made an impact on their lives, to/on an anonymous, but safe community/site

* Scope
    * The objective of this site is to create an experience for human to human social interaction in which our human quality surrounds **vulnerability**.
    * Although it is anonymous, users will be sharing a (**deep**) secret through image form.
    * To achieve this goal, we need to create an ongoing (blog) post for various users to post a secret, and be safely exposed in this space.
    * Functionality:
        * login button - for individuals to be able to log into their account (though it will not be revealed once posted)
        * logout button - users can log out of the site
        * Image URL - individuals have to copy and paste a link of the image that best represents their secret
        * Post button - Let users post URLs - and then we hardcore the URL’s so that they become the image source (in the code)
          * Once individual chooses the image file they want to reveal, their secret will be posted and writes it to the database
        * My Secrets button - Users are able to see their secrets that they posted, set apart from the main newsfeed of secrets
    * Content:
        * Newsfeed of posts to show users that this is a *legitimate* site for them to be vulnerable
        * Show options to edit and delete, just in case they want to adjust or retract what they post???

    * CRUD functions:
        * Create a post
        * Read data - Users know how to newsfeed the message by time stamp and to pull up people’s post history when they login
        * Update - Database will update when user submits/deletes a post, and the main newsfeed will also update accordingly
        * Delete option - Users can delete an old post if they want to not have it shown on the personal and main feed anymore
